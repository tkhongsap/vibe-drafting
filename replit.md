# Content Studio

## Overview
Content Studio is an AI-powered web application that helps users analyze content and generate engaging social media posts. The app uses Google's Gemini AI to:
- Analyze text, images, or URLs
- Generate social media posts in different styles (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Threads)
- Provide key insights and interesting facts
- Generate relevant hashtags
- Show trending topics

**Current State**: The application is fully configured and running in the Replit environment with all dependencies installed and the Gemini API integrated.

## Recent Changes
*Last Updated: November 1, 2025*

### Replit Authentication Integration (Latest)
- **Replaced mock authentication** with real Replit Auth supporting Google, GitHub, Twitter (X), Apple, and email/password login
- **Created PostgreSQL database** with users and sessions tables for account management
- **Implemented backend authentication** using Passport.js and OpenID Connect
- **Updated frontend** with useAuth hook and real user session management
- **All components updated** to use real user data (firstName, lastName, email, profileImageUrl)
- **Authentication endpoints ready**: `/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `/api/callback`, `/api/auth/user`
- **TypeScript/JavaScript interoperability**: Split schema into `schema.js` (runtime) and `schema.d.ts` (types) to support both Node.js backend and React frontend

### Backend Server & Security
- Created Express.js backend for URL content fetching and authentication
- Added SSRF protection and CORS configuration
- Backend runs on localhost:3001 (proxied via Vite)
- All authentication state managed server-side with secure sessions

### Initial Replit Setup
- Installed Node.js 20 and all npm dependencies
- Configured Vite to run on port 5000 with proper HMR settings for Replit's proxy environment
- Set up GEMINI_API_KEY secret for Google's Gemini AI service
- Created dev workflow running both frontend and backend servers
- Configured deployment for VM with build and run commands
- Application tested and confirmed working

### Key Features
1. **Content Analysis**: Analyze text, images, or URLs using Gemini AI
2. **Multi-Platform Support**: Generate posts for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and Threads
3. **Tone Control**: Adjust content tone (Professional, Casual, Inspiring, etc.)
4. **History Tracking**: View previously generated content
5. **Trending Topics**: Display current trending topics in the sidebar

### Environment Configuration
- **Frontend Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit's webview)
- **Backend Port**: 3001 (proxied through Vite)
- **Required Secrets**: 
  - GEMINI_API_KEY (Google AI Studio API key)
  - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string - auto-configured)
  - SESSION_SECRET (auto-generated by Replit)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (allows Replit proxy access)
- **HMR**: Configured for Replit's HTTPS proxy on port 443

### Authentication
The app uses **Replit Auth**, a production-ready authentication system that supports:
- **Multiple providers**: Google, GitHub, Twitter (X), Apple, email/password
- **Secure sessions**: Server-side session management with PostgreSQL storage
- **OpenID Connect**: Industry-standard authentication protocol
- **Automatic user management**: User accounts stored in PostgreSQL database

**Auth Flow**:
1. User clicks "Sign in" button → redirected to `/api/login`
2. Replit shows auth provider selection screen
3. User authenticates with chosen provider
4. Replit redirects back to `/api/callback`
5. Session created and user redirected to home page
6. Frontend checks auth status via `/api/auth/user` endpoint

### Deployment
The app is configured for Replit's VM deployment:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Run Command**: `node server.js & npx vite preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000`
- **Deployment Type**: VM (required for stateful authentication with sessions and database)
- **Database**: Automatically migrated to production on deployment

## User Preferences
None specified yet.

## Database Management
- **Schema Definition**: `shared/schema.js` (Drizzle ORM)
- **Migrations**: Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema changes to database
- **Tables**: 
  - `users`: Stores user account information (id, email, firstName, lastName, profileImageUrl)
  - `sessions`: Stores session data for authentication (managed by express-session)

## Notes
- Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN (not recommended for production - consider installing properly)
- Content history is currently stored in localStorage (should be migrated to database per-user)
- Backend files in `server/` are JavaScript for Node.js compatibility
- Database schema uses split approach: `schema.js` for runtime (Node.js imports) and `schema.d.ts` for TypeScript types (React imports)

## Backend Server
The application now includes a Node.js/Express backend server (`server.js`) that:
- Fetches real URL content using native fetch API
- Parses HTML content with cheerio to extract titles and main text
- Includes SSRF protection (blocks private IPs, localhost, and non-standard protocols)
- Runs on localhost:3001 in development
- Proxied through Vite dev/preview server via `/api` routes

## Security Features
- **SSRF Protection**: The backend validates URLs and blocks obvious private IP addresses, localhost, and non-HTTP(S) protocols
- **CORS Configuration**: Uses exact-match origin validation in production
- **URL Validation**: Enforces HTTPS/HTTP protocols and standard ports only

## Security Considerations & Limitations
- **DNS Rebinding Risk**: The current SSRF protection checks the URL hostname string but doesn't perform DNS resolution. An attacker with control over DNS could potentially bypass this by creating a domain that resolves to a private IP address. For high-security environments, consider implementing DNS-based validation using Node's dns.lookup() before fetching.
- **Vite allowedHosts**: Set to `true` for development to work with Replit's proxy. This is development-only and doesn't affect production builds.
- **Content History**: Stored in browser localStorage, which means data is local to each device and can be cleared by the user.
